Formalizing Mathematics in Agda
===============================

This is an open-ended project to formalize mathematics using the type theory of Agda programming language. Currently, I am focusing on formalizing Group Theory. My current long-term goal is to formalize a significant portion of undergraduate algebra (group, ring, field, module and Galois theories), basic algebraic geometry (curves, surfaces, Grassmanian varieties) and probability theory.

I will be focusing on classical mathematics. This means, all of these proofs (possibly) depend on the law of excluded middle. Moreover, I currently do not plan to spend any effort seperating theorems depend on this principle and those that do not. Once I get satisfactory results in my project, I might work on some constructive theories.

### Progress

#### First-Order Logic

Basic logical connectives and quantifiers are defined. Basic theorems are proved.
